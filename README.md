# Incremental-base

This work in progress is intended to be a starting point for developing idle incremental games using React and Next.js

Basic components will include
- resources to gather
- temporary upgrades purchased with resources
- reset mechanic
- prestige resources from reset
- permanant upgrades purchased with prestige
- time calculations per 'tick'
- offline progress

Resource names, upgrade names, upgrade costs, and upgrade cost increase ratio will be determined in a config.js file
